# Social Network API and Route Configuration

# Description

This repository contains all of the backend code for a starter social media app.

# Walkthrough Video

This walkthrough video details how to invoke the server and test the routes using isnomnia. I could not fit all 14 routes in the 5 minute time limit through Screencastify, so
[Part 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MlJlfCLwAzM9ZDi27huUFZUoi86uxjHj/view) entails the first 12 routes and [Part 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13EH9SwGInWzbF_eOQZ8IRpFPIBFsPCo7/view) entails the last 2 routes.
